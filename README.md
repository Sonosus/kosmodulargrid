# Kosmodular Grid

Inspired by modular grid, [Kosmodular Grid](http://www.kosmodulargrid.com/) is a website for makers of synth modules in the Kosmo format to show of their wares and to collect all of the current Kosmo format projects in one, easy to navigate place. I intend to implement a number of features such as search, filtering and maker homepages. Should there be sufficient interest in this project, there may be scope to add a case builder function, similar to modular grid. 

Guides coming soon for anyone who wishes to list a module on this site.
